# Minecraft Bedrock server, written in Swift

Why Swift?

1. Because it's a great modern high-performance language
2. It's must faster than Java or PHP, the two other leading options!
3. Swift-NIO provides non-blocking IO and should theoretically scale much better than any other mechanism
4. It's my personal favorite language, and while I know that's not a great reason, it's enough for me!

Disagree? That's fine!

This is a project I am from this day forward dedicating myself to. It will be complete, and it will be amazing!

What works so far:

* SwakNet (RakNet) is functional enough for basic testing, but needs work
* NetworkSettings handled!
* LoginPacket received and processed/decoded
* Gzip/Snappy compression
* Full NBT encode/decode support
